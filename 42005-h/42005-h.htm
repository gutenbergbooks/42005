<h3>LEGENDS AND SUPERSTITIONS RESPECTING BEES.</h3>

  <p>The Vicar of Morwenstow, among the beautiful poems to be found in his
  <i>Echoes from Old Cornwall</i>, has one entitled "A Legend of the Hive:"
  it commences&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Behold those winged images!</p>
      <p class="i1">Bound for their evening bowers;</p>
      <p>They are the nation of the bees,</p>
      <p class="i1">Born from the breath of flowers:</p>
      <p>Strange people are they; a mystic race</p>
      <p>In life, and food, and dwelling-place!"</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>As another poet has sung:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"His quidam signis, atque hæc exempla secuti,</p>
      <p><i>Esse Apibus partem Divinæ mentis</i> et haustus</p>
      <p>Ætherios dixere."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Mr. Hawker's Legend is to this effect: A Cornish woman, one summer,
  finding her bees refused to leave their "cloistered home," and "ceased to
  play around the cottage flowers," concealed a portion of the Holy
  Eucharist which she obtained at church:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"She bore it to her distant home,</p>
      <p class="i1">She laid it by the hive</p>
      <p>To lure the wanderers forth to roam,</p>
      <p class="i1">That so her store might thrive;&mdash;</p>
      <p class="hg1">'Twas a wild wish, a thought unblest,</p>
      <p>Some evil legend of the West.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"But lo! at morning-tide a sign,</p>
      <p class="i1">For wondering eyes to trace,</p>
      <p>They found above that Bread, a shrine</p>
      <p class="i1">Rear'd by the harmless race!</p>
      <p>They brought their walls from bud and flower,</p>
      <p>They built bright roof and beamy tower!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Was it a dream? or did they hear</p>
      <p class="i1">Float from those golden cells</p>
      <p>A sound, as of some psaltery near,</p>
      <p class="i1">Or soft and silvery bells?</p>
      <p>A low sweet psalm, that griev'd within</p>
      <p>In mournful memory of the sin!"</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The following passage from Howell's <i>Parley of Beasts</i>, Lond.
  1660, furnishes a similar legend of the piety of bees. Bee speaks:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Know, Sir, that we have also a religion as well as so exact a
  government among us here; our hummings you speak of are as so many hymns
  to the Great God of Nature; and ther is a miraculous example in
  <i>Cæsaries Cisterniensis</i>, how som of the Holy Eucharist being let
  fall in a medow by a priest, as he was returning from visiting a sick
  body, a swarm of bees being hard by took It up, and in a solemn kind of
  procession carried It to their hive, and there erected an altar of the
  purest wax for It, where It was found in that form, and
  untouched."&mdash;P. 144.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>It is remarkable that, in the Septuagint version of Prov. vi. 8., the
  bee is introduced after the ant, and reference is made to <span
  title="tên ergasian hôs semnên poieitai: ergas. sem." class="grk"
  >&tau;&#x1F74;&nu; &#x1F10;&rho;&gamma;&alpha;&sigma;&#x1F76;&alpha;&nu;
  &#x1F61;&sigmaf; &sigma;&epsilon;&mu;&nu;&#x1F74;&nu;
  &pi;&omicron;&iota;&epsilon;&#x1FD6;&tau;&alpha;&iota;:
  &#x1F10;&rho;&gamma;&alpha;&sigmaf;. &sigma;&epsilon;&mu;.</span> St.
  Ambrose translates it <i>operationem venerabilem</i>; St. Jerome, <i>opus
  castum</i>; Castalio, <i>augustum opus</i>; Bochart prefers <i>opus
  pretiosum, aut mirabile</i>.<a name="footnotetag1"
  href="#footnote1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Pliny has much to say about bees. I shall give an extract or two in
  the Old English of Philemon Holland:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Bees naturally are many times sick; and that do they shew most
  evidently: a man shall see it in them by their heavie looks and by their
  unlustines to their businesse: ye shall marke how some will bring forth
  others that be sicke and diseased into the warme sunne, and be readie to
  minister unto them and give them meat. Nay, ye shall have them to carie
  forth their dead, and to accompanie the corps full decently, as in a
  solemne funerall. If it chaunce that the king be dead of some pestilent
  maladie, the commons and subjects mourne, take thought, and grieve with
  heavie cheere and sad countenance: idle they be, and take no joy to do
  any thing: they gather in no provision: they march not forth: onely with
  a certain doleful humming they gather round about his corps, and will not
  away.</p>

  <p>"Then requisite it is and necessarie to sever and part the multitude,
  and so to take away the bodie from them: otherwise they would keepe a
  looking at the breathlesse carcasse, and never go from it, but still mone
  and mourne without end. And even then also they had need be cherished and
  comforted with good victuals, otherwise they would pine away and die with
  hunger."&mdash;Lib. <span class="sm">XI.</span> cap. xviii.</p>

</blockquote>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"We bury our dead with great solemnity; at the king's death there is a
  generall mourning and fasting, with a cessation from labour, and we use
  to go about his body with a sad murmur for many daies. When we are sick
  we have attendants appointed us, and the symptoms when we be sick are
  infallible, according to the honest, plain poet:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"If bees be sick (for all that live must die),</p>
      <p>That may be known by signes most certainly;</p>
      <p>Their bodies are discoloured, and their face</p>
      <p>Looks wan, which shows that death comes on apace.</p>
      <p>They carry forth their dead, and do lament,</p>
      <p>Hanging o' th' dore, or in their hives are pent.'"</p>
      <p class="i10"><i>Howell</i>, p. 138.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

</blockquote>

  <p>Of bees especially the proverb holds good, that "Truth is stranger
  than fiction." The discoveries of Huber, Swammerdam, Reaumur, Latreille,
  Bonnet, and other moderns, read more like a fairy-tale than anything
  else, and yet the subject is far from being exhausted. At the same time
  modern naturalists have substantiated the accuracy of the ancients in
  many statements which were considered ridiculous fables. The ancients
  <!-- Page 168 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page168"></a>{168}</span>anticipated us so far as even to have used
  <i>glass hives</i>, for the purpose of observing the wonderful
  proceedings of this winged nation. Bochart, quoting an old writer,
  says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Fecit illis Aristoteles <i>Alveare Vitreum</i>, ut introspiceret, qua
  ratione ad opus se accingerent. Sed abnuerunt quidquam operari, donec
  interiora vitri luto oblevisset."&mdash;<i>Hierozoicon</i>, Lond. 1663,
  folio, Part II. p. 514.</p>

<div class="note">
  <a name="footnote1"></a><b>Footnote 1:</b><a
  href="#footnotetag1">(return)</a>
  <p>The bee is praised for her pious labours in the offices of the Roman
  Church, "as the unconscious contributor of the substance of her paschal
  light." "Alitur enim liquantibus ceris, quas in substantiam pretiosæ
  hujus lampadis <i>Mater Apia</i> eduxit."&mdash;<i>Office of Holy
  Saturday.</i></p>

<h3>OXFORD JEU D'ESPRIT.</h3>

  <p>The following <i>jeu d'esprit</i> appeared at Oxford in 1819: printed,
  not published, but laid simultaneously on the tables of all the Common
  Rooms. No author's name was attached to it then, and therefore no attempt
  is now made to supply this deficiency by conjecture. Since the attention
  of the discerning public has lately been directed towards the University
  of Oxford, probably with the expectation of finding some faults in her
  system of education, it is possible that some of those who are engaged or
  interested in that inquiry may be amused and instructed by the good
  sense, humour, logic, and Latinity of this satire.</p>

<h3>ANSAREYS IN MOUNT LEBANON.</h3>

  <p>In the romance of <i>Trancred</i>, Mr. D'Israeli mentions the
  Ansareys, one of the tribes of Lebanon, as worshipping the old heathen
  gods, Jupiter, Apollo, and Astarte, or Venus. A writer of fiction is
  certainly not expected to be bound to fact; but in such a matter as the
  present religion of an existing people, I feel doubtful whether to
  suppose this religion his own invention, or if he has any authority for
  it, and its connexion with pagan Antioch. A people to-day retaining the
  worship of the old gods of Greece and Syria, is a matter of great
  interest. I have looked into Volney's <i>Travels in Syria and Egypt</i>,
  and in some later writers, but none of them state the paganism of Tancred
  to be the religion of the Ansareys. It is, however, said to be a mystery,
  so not impossibly the account in <i>Tancred</i> may be the reality. In
  the same work, the Sheikhs of Sheikhs, and his tribe, the Beni-Rechab
  children of Rechab, are said to be Jews on horseback, inhabiting the
  desert, and resembling the wandering Arabs in their mode of life. This
  also is curious, if there be such a people; and some of your readers
  acquainted with the history and manners of Syria may give information on
  these matters. The other tribes of Lebanon are singular and equally
  interesting:&mdash;the Maronites, Christians of the Roman Catholic sect,
  who, however, allow their priests to marry; the Metualis, Mahomedans of
  the sect of Ali; and the Druses, whose religion is unknown, and, as
  Lamartine tells us, was entirely so to Lady Hester Stanhope, who lived
  years in the middle of them. Volney divides the Ansareys <!-- Page 170
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page170"></a>{170}</span>in several
  sects, of whom one worshipped the sun, another a dog, and a third had an
  obscene worship, with such lewd nocturnal meetings as were fabled of the
  Yesedee.</p>

<h3>PRIMERS OF THE REIGN OF QUEEN ELIZABETH.</h3>

  <p>Little is known respecting the Primers of this reign, and yet several
  editions were published. My object will be to give some information on
  the subject, in the hope that more may be elicited from your
  correspondents.</p>

  <p>There is an edition of the year 1559, 4to. Two copies only are known
  at present; one in the library at Christ Church, Oxford, and the other at
  Jesus College, Cambridge. It has been reprinted by the Parker Society.
  This Primer contains certain prayers for the dead, as they stand in that
  of Henry VIII., 1545. In short, with the exception of "An Order for
  Morning Prayer," with which it commences, this Primer follows the
  arrangement of that of 1545; some things, relative to saints, angels, and
  the Virgin Mary, having been excluded.</p>

  <p>But I have in my possession another edition in 12mo. of this reign, of
  which I can trace no other copy. My book wants the title, and
  consequently I cannot ascertain its date. It was formerly in Gough's
  possession. I am inclined to think that it is earlier than the edition
  reprinted by the Parker Society.</p>

  <p>Unlike the book of 1559, mine commences with the Catechism, but the
  subsequent arrangement is the same. The differences, when any exist,
  consist in a more literal following of the Primer of 1545. The Prayers
  for the Dead are retained as in the book of 1559. The Graces, also, are
  more numerous in my edition, and some of them are not found even in King
  Henry's book. One consists of an address, as from the master of the
  family, with an answer from the other members. In some respects this is
  similar to a form in King Edward's Primer, while in others it is
  altogether different. At the close of the Graces, the book of 1559 has
  the words "God save our Queen and Realm," while in my edition the reading
  is the same as in the book of 1545, "Lorde, save thy Churche, our Quene,
  and Realme," &amp;c.</p>

  <p>In "The Dirige" there is a very singular variation. In 1559 we find
  "Ego Dixi, Psalm Esaic xxxviii.;" in 1545 it is only "Esa. xxxviii.;" in
  that of 1546 the form is "Ego Dixi, Psal. Esa. xxxviii.;" and my edition
  has "Ego Dixi, Psal. xxxv.," being different from all the rest.</p>

  <p>Some curious typographical errors are also found in my edition. In the
  Catechism the word king is substituted for queen. In the third petition
  in the Litany for the Queen, we have "That it may please thee to be hys
  defendour, and gevinge hym," &amp;c.; yet in the previous clauses the
  pronoun is correctly used. It would seem that the printer had the Primer
  of 1545 or 1546 before him, and that in these cases he followed his copy
  without making the necessary alterations.</p>

  <p>Such are the more remarkable differences between my edition and that
  of 1559.</p>

  <p>There is a Primer of this reign in the Bodleian, quite different from
  mine and that of 1559. In this the Prayers for the Dead are expunged, and
  the character of the book is altogether dissimilar. Two copies of this
  book exist in the Bodleian, which have been usually regarded as different
  editions. From a careful examination, however, I have ascertained that
  they are the same edition. One copy has the title, with the date 1566 on
  the woodcut border; the other wants the title, but has the colophon,
  bearing the date 1575. The latter is the true date of the book, and the
  date on the title is merely that of some other book, for which the
  compartment had been used in 1566. Such variations are common with early
  books. I have several volumes bearing an earlier date on the title than
  in the colophon. Thus, the first edition of Sir Thomas Elyot's <i>Castle
  of Health</i> has 1534 on the title, and 1539 in the colophon. The latter
  was the true date. It may be remarked that the two books in the Bodleian
  of 1575 will together make up a perfect copy.</p>

  <p>Some of your correspondents may be able to mention another copy of the
  edition which I possess. I am very anxious to discover another.</p>

<h2>Minor Notes.</h2>

  <p><i>Objective and Subjective.</i>&mdash;I tried, a little while ago, to
  show in your pages that this antithesis, though not a good pair of terms,
  is intelligible, and justified by good English usage. But I must allow
  that the writers who use these terms, do all that is possible to put
  those who justify them in the wrong. In a French work at least, recently
  published, I find what appears to me a curious application of the
  corresponding words in that language. M. Auguste Comte, in the preface to
  the third volume of his <i>Système de Politique Positive</i>, speaks of
  some of his admirers who had by their "cotisations," or contributions,
  supported him while he was writing the work; and he particularly
  celebrates one of them, Mr. Wallace, an American, adding:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Devenu jusqu'ici le principal de mes souscripteurs, Wallace a
  perpétué <i>subjectivement</i> son patronage <i>objectif</i>, en me
  leguant une annuité de cinq cent francs."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>I must confess that the metaphysics according to which a sum paid by a
  living man is <i>objectif</i>, and a legacy <i>subjectif</i>, is beyond
  my depth. <!-- Page 171 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page171"></a>{171}</span></p>

  <p>While I write, as if writers of all kinds were resolved to join in
  perplexing the use of these unfortunate words, I read in a journal,
  "objective discussion in the sense of hostile or adverse discussion,
  discussion which proposed <i>objections</i>." I think this is hard upon
  the word, and unfair usage of it.</p>

  <p><i>Lucy Walters, the Duke of Monmouth's Mother.</i>&mdash;The death of
  this unfortunate woman is usually stated to have taken place at Paris.
  The date is not given, and the authority cited is John Evelyn. But
  Evelyn's words have been misunderstood. He says, speaking of the Duke of
  Monmouth's execution:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"His mother, whose name was Barlow, daughter of some very mean
  creatures, was a beautiful strumpet, whom I had often seen at Paris; she
  died miserably, without anything to bury her."&mdash;<i>Diary</i>, July
  15, 1685.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This passage surely does not imply that she <i>died</i> at Paris? In
  the Parish Registers of Hammersmith is the following entry:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"1683, June 5, Lucy Walters bur."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>which I am fully persuaded records the death of one of King Charles's
  quondam mistresses.</p>

  <p><i>General Haynau's Corpse.</i>&mdash;A most extraordinary account has
  reached us in a private letter from Vienna to a high personage here, and
  has been the talk of our <i>salons</i> for the last few days. It appears
  that the circumstance of the death of General Haynau presented a
  phenomenon of the most awful kind on record. For many days after death
  the warmth of life yet lingered in the right arm and left leg of the
  corpse, which remained limpid and moist, even bleeding slightly when
  pricked. No delusion, notwithstanding, could be maintained as to the
  reality of death, for the other parts of the body were completely
  mortified, and interment became necessary before the two limbs above
  mentioned had become either stiff or cold. The writer of the letter
  mentioned that this strange circumstance has produced the greatest awe in
  the minds of those who witnessed it, and that the emperor had been so
  impressed with it, that his physicians had forbidden the subject to be
  alluded to in his presence. Query, Can the above singular statement be
  verified? It was copied from a French paper, immediately after the
  decease of General Haynau was known in Paris.</p>

  <p>"The events we are witnesses of in the course of the longest life

  <p>There is a work of which few know the value, but yet a work of the

<h3>BURIAL-PLACE OF THURSTAN, ARCHBISHOP OF
YORK.</h3>

  <p>The church of All Saints, in Pontefract, county York, was some years
  ago partly restored for divine worship; and during the progress of the
  works, a broken slab was discovered in the chancel part of the church,
  upon which was cut an archiepiscopal cross, extending from the top
  apparently to the bottom. On the upper part of the stone, and on each
  side of the cross, was a circle or ring cut down the middle by a dagger;
  and bearing on the circle the following inscription in Old English
  characters:</p>

<p class="ac"><img src="images/ingodis.png" class="middle" style="height:2ex;" alt="+ in . god . is . all ." title="+ in . god . is . all ." /></p>

  <p>In the middle of the stone, and on each side of the cross, also appear
  a shield emblazoned with a rabbit or coney <i>sejant</i>.<a
  name="footnotetag4" href="#footnote4"><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Beneath this part appears the commencement of the inscription, which
  seems to have run across the surface of the stone, "Orate pro anim...."
  Here the stone is broken across, and the lower part not found.</p>

  <p>Can any of your numerous readers inform me if this stone could
  possibly be the tombstone of Thurstan, Archbishop of York? It is said
  that he resigned the see of York after holding it twenty-six years:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Being old and sickly, he would have been made a monk of Pontefract,
  but he had scarcely put off his pontifical robes, and put on his monk's
  dress, when death came upon him and made him assume his grave-clothes;
  for he survived but eleven days after his resignation, dying Feb. 5,
  1140."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Thurstan is stated to have been buried in the Monastery; but may he
  not have been buried in the church of All Saints, which was the
  conventual church of the Priory of St. John the Evangelist, and was
  situated adjoining the Grange, the site of the Priory? In the bull of
  Pope Celestine, "right of burial in this church was granted to the monks,
  saving the privileges of neighbouring churches." (<i>Ch. de Pontif.</i>

<h2>Minor Queries.</h2>

  <p><i>Admiral Hopson.</i>&mdash;In Tomkins' <i>History of the Isle of
  Wight</i> (1796), vol. ii. p. 123., an anecdote is told of a native of
  Bonchurch named Hobson, who afterwards became Admiral Hobson. It is
  mentioned that he was <i>an orphan</i>, bound apprentice to a tailor; and
  that being struck with the sight of a squadron of ships off the Isle of
  Wight, he rowed off in a boat to them, and was received on the admiral's
  ship; that <i>the next day</i>, in an engagement with <i>the French</i>,
  when his ship was engaged yard-arm and yard-arm with the enemy, he
  climbed up the mast, clambered to the enemy's yard-arm, mounted to the
  top-gallant mast, and took down the flag. This created consternation in
  the enemy, who were soon defeated. Hobson was <!-- Page 173 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page173"></a>{173}</span>promoted to be an
  officer, and ultimately became an admiral.</p>

  <p>This is the story as told by Tomkins. I wish to know what was his
  authority.</p>

  <p>Consulting Chernoch's <i>Lives of the Admirals</i>, I find mention of
  Admiral Sir Thomas Hopson, a native of Bonchurch; who ran away from his
  parents, and did not return to his home till he was an admiral. This Sir
  Thos. Hopson was made second lieutenant in 1672, the year of the action
  in Solbay, in which the Earl of Sandwich perished. He rose to the rank of
  Vice-Admiral of the Red; and in the action of Vigo, in 1702, he
  distinguished himself, and was knighted in consequence. He received a
  pension of 500<i>l.</i> a year, and retired from the service in this
  year. He died in 1717. After he quitted the navy, he became Member of
  Parliament for Newtown, in the Isle of Wight.</p>

  <p>It is evident that this Hopson is the <i>Hobson</i> of Tomkins; and
  that Tomkins spoke of the French by mistake for the <i>Dutch</i> enemy.
  But I cannot discover what authority he had for his account of the manner
  in which young Hobson first distinguished himself.</p>

  <p><i>Ancient Tenure of Lands.</i>&mdash;I should feel obliged to any of
  your readers who would inform me as to the ancient tenure by which
  estates were held in this country. For instance, a manor, including
  within its limits several hamlets, is held by A, who grants by
  subinfeudation one of the said hamlets to B; B dies, leaving a son and
  successor, who continues in possession of the hamlet, and grants leases,
  &amp;c., and thus for several generations. My question is, did A, in
  granting to B, relinquish all interest in the hamlet, or how much did he
  still retain, since in after years the hamlet is found to have reverted
  to him, and no allusion is afterwards made to the subinfeudatory lords
  who possessed it for some generations? It is presumed that in early times
  lords of a manor were owners of the <i>lands</i> of the manor of which
  they were lords; at present an empty title is all that remains. When did
  the practice of alienating lands by a piecemeal partition and sale
  commence? and did a subinfeudatory lord possess the power of alienation?
  In fact, what is the origin of the numerous small freeholds into which
  our ancient manors are broken up?</p>

  <i>Freswick</i>. Is <i>Fresick</i> a contracted form of <i>Freswick</i>?
  and if so, has it some reference to a settlement of the Frisians
  (anciently Fresians) on this coast? The village Freswick, on the borders
  of the Lek, and another Freswick in the neighbourhood of Deventus, both
  in the Netherlands, near the Frisians, are supposed to owe their names to
  a settlement or refuge of those first parents of the Anglo-Saxons.</p>

  <p><i>Has Execution by Hanging been survived?</i>&mdash;I have heard

  undergone infliction of the punishment of hanging without total
  extinction of life; but I have always been disposed to look upon such
  accounts as mere fables, till lately, in turning over some newspapers of
  the year 1740, I found a case mentioned, under such circumstances that,
  if it were untrue, its refutation might have been easily accomplished. By
  <i>The Craftsman</i> of Saturday, Sept 27, 1740, it appears one William
  Dewell had been concerned in the violation, robbery, and murder of a
  young woman in a barn at Acton (which place has so recently been the
  scene of another horrible crime). <i>The Craftsman</i> of Saturday, Nov.
  29, 1740, states that Dewell, having undergone execution, and being
  brought to Surgeons Hall to be anatomised, <i>symptoms of life appeared,
  and he quite recovered</i>.<a name="footnotetag5"

  <p><i>Queen Elizabeth and the Ring.</i>&mdash;Has the common story,
  respecting the Earl of Essex sending a ring to Queen Elizabeth by the
  Countess of Nottingham, in order to procure his pardon, any foundation in
  fact?</p>

  <p class="author">T. T. W.</p>

<div class="note">
  <p>[Miss Strickland seems to have examined the traditionary notices of
  this love-token. She says: "The romantic story of the ring which, it is
  said, the queen had given to Essex in a moment of fondness as a pledge of
  her affection, with an intimation 'that, if he forfeited her favour, if
  he sent it back to her, the sight of it would ensure her forgiveness,'
  must not be lightly rejected. It is not only related by Osborne, who is
  considered a fair authority for other things, and quoted by historians of
  all parties, but it is a family tradition of the Careys, who were the
  persons most likely to be in the secret, as they were the relations and
  friends of all the parties concerned, and enjoyed the confidence of Queen
  Elizabeth. The following is the version given by Lady Elizabeth Spelman,
  a descendant of that House, to the editor of her great-uncle Robert
  Carey's <i>Memoirs</i>: 'When Essex lay under sentence of death, he
  determined to try the virtue of the ring, by sending it to the queen, and
  claiming the benefit of her promise; but knowing he was surrounded by the
  creatures of those who were bent on taking his life, he was fearful of
  trusting it to any of his attendants. At length, looking out of his
  window, he saw early one morning a boy whose countenance pleased him, and
  him he induced by a bribe to carry the ring, which he threw down to him
  from above, to the Lady Scrope his cousin, who had taken so friendly
  interest in his fate. The boy, by mistake, carried it to the Countess of
  Nottingham, the cruel sister of the fair and gentle Scrope, and, as both
  these ladies were of the royal bedchamber, the mistake might easily
  occur. The countess carried the ring to her husband the Lord Admiral, who
  was the deadly foe of Essex, and told him the message, but he bade her
  suppress both.' The queen, unconscious of the accident, waited in the
  painful suspense of an angry lover for the expected token to arrive; but
  not receiving it, she concluded he was too proud to make this last appeal
  to her tenderness, and, after having once revoked the warrant, she
  ordered the execution to proceed. It was not till the axe had absolutely
  fallen, the the world could believe that Elizabeth would take the life of
  Essex."&mdash;<i>Lives of the Queens of England</i>, vol. iv. p.

  former possessor of the copy now lying before me. From this work, in
  which Burnet, Kennett, and others are very severely criticised, I send a
  curious extract relating to Burnet:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"He puts me in mind of a petty canon of Exeter, to whom he used
  military force upon refusal to alter the prayers at his command until he
  should receive the proper instructions. He brought a file of musqueteers
  upon him, and crammed his amendments down his throat. This man, in a
  journey to London, visited the musical part of the Church of Salisbury,
  and was as usual asked to sing an anthem at evening service. He was a
  lover of humour, and singing the 137th Psalm, threw out his right hand
  towards the bishop's stall, and with great emphasis pronounced the words,
  'If I forget thee&mdash;if I forget thee,' repeating it so often that the
  whole congregation inquired after the meaning of it. It was from that
  time ordered that no strange songster should come up more."&mdash;P.

  particulars of this monument, pedigree, and arms?</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Elffin ap Gwyddno.</span></p>

<div class="note">
  <p>[The monument was commenced by the second Sir Thomas Eden in 1615, and
  contained, some years since, an inscription upon brass, a limbed picture,
  and upon the wall, beneath the canopy, a pedigree of the marriages of the
  family with those of Waldegrave, Peyton, Steward, Workington, Harrys, and
  St. Clere. The whole having fallen into ruin, it became necessary in 1851
  to remove it. The brass being gone, the following inscription upon the
  verge of the canopy alone was visible: "This tombe was finished at
  y<sup>e</sup> coste of Sir Thomas Eden, Knight, Maie 16, 1617." A large
  mural monument to the memory of several of the Eden family is about to be
  erected by its side. See the Rev. Charles Badham's <i>History and
  Antiquities of All Saints' Church, Sudbury</i>, pp. 44-46. and 162.,

  the dedication that he was adjutant to the 10th Royal Hussars, of which
  the Hon. F. Howard was major. He says:</p>

  stated in the poem; and during that dreadful bloody day, he and I were
  frequently discoursing about our situation; the good position occupied by
  us; the humane feeling of our brave Duke for choosing that situation to
  save men's lives; and once during the day our regiment was completely
  sheltered; all the balls from the enemy flying over our heads, except one
  that dropped about six yards from the major and me. We were at that time
  dismounted about twenty minutes, to rest the horses. I took the ball up;
  we looked at it, and had a good hearty laugh over it."</p>

  the last words he spoke, for in half a minute afterwards we were right
  amongst them, slashing away; then there was no time to talk. We quickly
  made them turn their backs towards us; but there was one square of
  infantry that stood firm. That square made sad havoc among us. The major
  was killed by that square. He was not six yards from the muzzles of the
  French firelocks when he was shot. He fell off his horse, and, I believe,
  never moved a finger; but I had not a moment's time to stop, for we had

  <p>Then follow some reflections which I abstain from quoting, as the way

  <p>The criticism of the note quoted by G. D. is sound: "Hardman was no
  poet, but he could describe graphically what he saw and did." The poem
  seems to have been the result of a sudden thought. In the dedication he
  says it was not begun till May 18, and "A Letter to the Right Hon. George
  Canning," appended to it, is dated June 4. In the letter he says, that if
  he "can get into the printing-house again without loss," he will answer
  Mr. Canning effectually on the Catholic question. He also hopes "to get
  before the public every week," and "to show that all gentlemen professing
  the law are the most abused, and at the same time more honest than any
  other class in this kingdom." Had the last-mentioned hope been fulfilled,
  I think I should have heard of it. I have not met with any other work
  bearing Captain Hardman's name; and probably his printer's bill (he was
  his own publisher) put an end to his literary career.</p>

  <p>I subjoin two specimens of the poem which, though not relating to the
  subject of G. D.'s Query, may be interesting if you have room for them,
  as such poetry is not published every day. An exhortation to good conduct
  ends thus:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'Therefore let us prepare, the call may be very soon;</p>
      <p>Then we shall not despair, if the call be made before noon:</p>
      <p>But if our sins weigh us down, what misery and woe!</p>
      <p>Ah! devils all slily squinting, and to them we must go.</p>
      <p>Their eyes are flames of fire, their tongues are frightful darts,</p>
      <p>Their looks a venomous ire, ready to pierce our feeble hearts,</p>
      <p>Their cloven feet of enmity, their taily stings so long,</p>
      <p>Their poisonous hearts of calomel, daily forming vicious songs."&mdash;P. 12.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The other describes his own narrow escape, and the death of an
  artilleryman:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"A ball from their infantry went through my jacket,</p>
      <p>Took the skin off my side, and made me racket.</p>
      <p>My sword-belt turned it, otherwise through it must have gone.</p>
      <p>The stroke was very severe, compare it to a sharp gore.</p>
      <p>Captain Fitzroy said, 'Harding is severely wounded;</p>
      <p>A ball has gone through his side: here it comes, rounded!'</p>

      <p>A ball came that instant and turned him into brass.</p>
      <p>It cut him in two; he then turned as yellow as that metal.</p>

<h3>DATES OF BIRTHS AND DEATHS OF THE PRETENDERS.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. viii., p. 565.)</p>

  <p>Though it is much to be regretted that the dates in question are not
  recorded on the Stuart monument in St. Peter's, yet the deficiency is in
  part supplied by the cenotaph raised to the memory of his elder brother
  by Cardinal York, in his cathedral church at Frascati. From it we find
  that Charles Edward deceased on 31st January, 1788, at the age of
  sixty-seven years and one month. This date also fixes the year of his
  birth at 1720, and the month December; most probably the 28th, though
  often given as the 31st. We give a copy of the inscription below.</p>

  <p>The date of the birth and decease of James III. is correctly given in
  "N. &amp; Q.," Vol viii., p. 565.</p>

  <p>An account of the sepulchral monument of the last of the Stuarts may
  interest the readers of "N. &amp; Q." In the south aisle of St. Peter's,
  and against the first pier of the nave, is the monument of the Stuarts.
  It was sculptured by Canova to the memory of James, the old Pretender;
  Charles Edward, the young Pretender; and Henry Benedict, the Cardinal,
  who was known in Rome as Cardinal York. Part of the expense of the
  monument was defrayed by George IV., who sent a donation of fifty pounds
  for the purpose to Pius VII. The monument is built on to the masonry of
  the pier, of white marble, about fifteen feet high, and is in the form of
  the frustrum of a <!-- Page 178 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page178"></a>{178}</span>pyramid, and surmounted above the
  entablature by the royal arms of England. Below the arms are profile
  portraits in bas-relief of James, Charles Edward, and Henry Benedict,
  surmounted by a festoon of flowers. Beneath the portraits is the
  following inscription:</p>

<p class="ac">"Jacobo III.<br/>
Jacobi II. Magnæ Brit. regis filio,<br/>
Karolo Edvardo,<br/>
Et Henrico, decano Patrum Cardinalium,<br/>
Jacobi III. filiis,<br/>
Regiæ Stirpis Stuardiæ postremis.<br/>
<span class="sm">A.D. MDCCCXIX.</span><br/>
Beati mortui,<br/>
Qui in Domino moriuntur."</p>

  <p>There is a representation of panelled doors, as if leading to a vault,
  below the inscription, though their sepulchre is not in this locality; a
  small triangular slab of marble surmounts the door, with the words "Beati
  mortui," &amp;c. A weeping angel in bas-relief guards the doorway on each
  side; the head of each angel resting on the bosom, the wings drooping,
  the hands elevated, joined together, and resting on the end of an
  extinguished and inverted torch. The figures of the two angels are
  exquisitely beautiful, and among Canova's finest works.</p>

  <p>The bodies, however, of these last representatives of a fallen line
  are not buried beneath this monument, but in the crypt under the dome,
  and in that portion of it called the "Grotto Vecchie." There, in the
  first aisle to the left on entering, against the wall, a tomb about six
  feet long by three broad contains all that remains of the ashes of the
  last of the Stuarts. Over it is a plain slab of marble, with an
  inscription to announce that this is the burial-place of "James III.,
  Charles III., and Henry IX., Kings of England." Even in death this royal
  race has not abandoned the claim they were unable to enforce.</p>

  <p>Opposite to this monument is the monument of Maria Clementina,
  daughter of James Sobieski, and grand-daughter of John Sobieski, King of
  Poland, wife of James III., and mother of Charles Edward and Henry
  Benedict. She married on 3rd September, 1719, and died at Rome on 18th
  January, 1735. The monument stands against the wall over the door leading
  to the staircase by which the public ascend to the cupola. Pietro Bracci
  carved the monument from the design of Filippo Barigioni, consisting of a
  pyramid of porphyry on a base of Porta Santa marble, the whole relieved
  by a ground of blue sky and clouds painted on the wall. Under the
  elevated pyramid is the sarcophagus of porphyry, above which are two
  marble statues, one of Charity, and the other of an infant, which support
  a circular medallion portrait in mosaic, of Maria Clementina, by Cav.
  Cristofori, from a painting by Lewis Stern. Drapery of Sicilian
  alabaster, with a fringe of gilded bronze, falls in ample folds on both
  sides of the sarcophagus, which is flanked by two angels, one holding a
  crown and the other a sceptre; and upon it the words are carved "Maria
  Clementina M. Britann. Fr. et Hibern. Regina." It was erected by the
  "Fabbrica di S. Pietro," at the cost of 18,000 scudi. There is another
  monument in Rome to Maria Clementina, and it is in the church of the SS.
  Apostoli, in the nave, upon the second pier on the right-hand side. It
  contains her heart, and consists of a circular urn of verde antico,
  surmounted by a crown, over which two angels hover, of white marble; and
  below, a tablet of rosso antico, bearing an inscription, thus:</p>

<p class="ac">"Mariæ Clementinæ Magnæ Britanniæ<br/>
Etc. Reginæ, Fratres Min. Cons. venerabundi pp.<br/>
<br/>
Hic Clementinæ remanent præcordia, nam cor<br/>
Cælestis fecit ne superesset amor."</p>

  <p>Charles Edward has also another monument in addition to the one in St.
  Peter's, namely, at Frascati, fourteen miles from Rome, of which see
  Cardinal York was bishop. Its position is to the left of the great
  entrance door; the inscription runs thus:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Hic situs est Karolus Odoardus, cui pater Jacobus III., Rex Angliæ,
  Scotiæ, Franciæ, Hiberniæ, primus natorum, paterni juris et regiæ
  dignitatis successor et hæres, qui, domicilio sibi Romæ delecto, Comes
  Albanyensis dictus est. Vixit annos <span class="sm">LXVII</span> et
  mensem: decessit in pace <img src="images/chirho.png" class="middle" style="height:3ex;" alt="Chi-rho" title="Chi-rho"
  /> pridie Kal. Febr. anno <span class="sm">MDCCLXXXVIII</span>.</p>

  <p>"Henricus Card. Episc. Tusculan., cui paterna jura titulique cessere,
  Ducis Eboracensis appellatione resumpta, in ipso luctu amori et
  reverentiæ obsequutus, indicto in templum suum funere multis cum lacrimis
  præsens justa persolvit fratri augustissimo, honoremque sepulchri
  ampliorem destinavit."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Henry Benedict, or Cardinal York, was born at Rome on 6th of March,
  1725. He was Bishop of Ostia and Velletri, Dean of the Sacred College,
  Vice-Chancellor of the Roman Church, Arch-priest of St. Peter's, and
  Prefect of the Fabric of St. Peter's. He deceased at Frascati in July,
  1807. In the church at Frascati, on the left hand of the entrance into
  the sanctuary, there is a monument in his honour; but I have not a copy
  of the inscription.</p>

  <p>It is needless to add that though all these monuments are made of the
  richest marbles, and at great cost, the effect produced by them as
  Christian sepulchral monuments is unsatisfactory in the extreme. The
  inscriptions upon them are in equally bad taste.</p>

<h3>"COULD WE WITH INK," ETC.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. viii., p. 648., &amp;c.)</p>

  <p>I agree with your learned correspondent <span class="sc">Mr.
  Margoliouth</span>, that the authorship of the lines alluded to must be
  ascertained by comparing <i>the whole</i>, and not by a single
  expression. It seems to me highly probable that they were suggested,
  either by the Chaldee hymn quoted by your correspondent, or by the lines
  of Chaucer, quoted "N. &amp; Q.," Vol. viii., p. 180. I cannot, however,
  agree that the popular lines in question are a are a translation of the
  Chaldee hymn. The improbability will appear, if we compare them (as given
  "N. &amp; Q.," Vol. viii., p. 127.) with the following version of the
  hymn; which, although metrical, will be found sufficiently literal:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"To write the eternal power of God, no effort would suffice;</p>
      <p>Although, such writing to contain, the volume were the skies;</p>
      <p>Each reed a pen; and for the ink, the waters of the sea;</p>
      <p>And though each dweller on the earth, an able scribe should be."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>This hymn, I admit, is more succinct than the popular lines; but at
  the same time I cannot but think that its author was indebted to the
  passage in the Koran ("N. &amp; Q.," Vol. viii., p. 422.), immediately,
  or through Chaucer; who has not only the general sentiment as there
  found, but also&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Eche sticke a pen, eche man a scrivener able."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>I am equally convinced, that Mahomet himself took the thought from the
  passage in the New Testament, as suggested by your correspondent E. G. R.
  Each successive writer appears to have added something to what he
  borrowed. But when the Evangelist, John, had said, "<i>The world
  itself</i> would not be able to contain the books that should be
  written," it was easy for one writer to suppose an inkstand capacious as
  the sea; and for another to supply parchment, pens, and scribes <i>ad
  libitum</i>. That the phrase in the Koran should <i>now</i> be common in
  the East, is not wonderful, considering the extent to which Mahomedanism
  has prevailed there. After all, I do not think that the <i>additions</i>
  are any very great improvements. Without disputing about tastes, I may
  say at least that, for my own part, I greatly prefer the simplicity of
  the original idea, as expressed by the beloved disciple.</p>

<h3>MACKEY'S THEORY OF THE EARTH.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. viii., pp. 468. 565.; Vol. ix., p. 89.)</p>

  <p>A friend called on me this morning with the Number containing a notice
  of S. A. Mackey, supposing that, being a neighbour, I could furnish a few
  particulars of that extraordinary man. The whole of his MSS. came into my
  possession after his demise. Amongst these was a MS. of his Life, written
  by himself, and of which I took a faithful copy: which I have transcribed
  for gentlemen who wish to possess a copy. I am ready to furnish any
  gentleman with a copy, neatly written, book included, for 5<i>s.</i> It
  consists of fifty-two pages large demy 4to. The original is in the
  possession of a Mr. Brereton of Flitcham, near Lynn, Norfolk, to whom I
  sold all the MSS., Mr. Brereton being an intimate friend of S. A.
  Mackey.</p>

  <p>I have on sale a copy of Mr. Mackey's <i>Works</i>, selected by Mr.
  Shickle, another intimate friend; neatly done up in coloured cloth. Also
  a copy of his <i>Mythological Astronomy</i>, with copious notes, in one
  hundred pages. Also, an Appendix of forty-eight pages. And another copy
  of the MS. Astronomy, with notes; but minus the Appendix.</p>

  <p>I may as well inform you, that a friend of mine has in his possession
  a half-length full-size portrait of Mr. Mackey; admirably executed, and
  in prime condition, in a handsome frame. I believe it is for sale. I
  assure you, when I first saw it, I felt at the moment a kind of impulse
  to shake hands with my old friend and neighbour.</p>

  <p>I shall feel great pleasure in answering any inquiries, so far as my
  knowledge extends. His Life is truly interesting; being that of a man
  born in sorrow, and cradled in adversity. Like him, I am a self-taught
  humble individual, and in my eighty-second year.</p>

  <p>In July, 1830, Sampson Arnold Mackey delivered a course of six
  "astro-historical lectures" in a large room near the Philanthropic
  Institution. The attendance was full, considering the subject, and I was
  surprised at the admiration which many well-educated persons expressed
  for his strange theories, to which they seemed to give full assent. To me
  his calculations and etymologies appeared as good as those of Pluche, Sir
  W. Drummond, Volney, and Dupuis, but no better. I met him at the house of
  the late Dr. Wright, then resident physician to Bethlehem Hospital. He
  was quiet and unassuming; but so perfectly satisfied that he had proved
  his system, that though ready to explain, he declined to answer
  objections, or defend his opinions. As a remarkable example of "the
  pursuit of knowledge under difficulties," he excited sympathy, and I
  believe that he disposed of all the copies of his various works then
  unsold.</p>

<h3>DO CONJUNCTIONS JOIN PROPOSITIONS ONLY?</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. viii., pp. 514. 629.)</p>

  <p>As my name appears to have been referred to by two of your
  correspondents, <span class="sc">Mr. Ingleby</span> and H. C. K., in
  connexion with the above question, I request to be permitted to state my
  real views upon it, together with the grounds upon which they rest. In
  doing this I can only directly refer to the observations of H. C. K., not
  having seen those of <span class="sc">Mr. Ingleby</span> to which he
  makes allusion.</p>

  <p>Admitting that there are many conjunctions which connect propositions
  only, I am unable to coincide with the view of my friend Dr. Latham and
  other grammarians, that the property is universal. And I agree with <span
  class="sc">Mr. Ingleby</span>, as quoted by H. C. K., in thinking that
  the incorrectness of that view may be <i>proved</i>. We possess the power
  of conceiving of any distinct classes of things, as "trees," "flowers,"
  &amp;c. And we possess the power of connecting such conceptions in
  thought, so as to form, for instance, the conception of that collection
  of things which consists of "trees and flowers" together. If we possess
  the power of <i>performing</i> this mental operation, we have clearly
  also the power of <i>expressing</i> it by a sign. This sign is the
  conjunction "and." It is assumed, what consciousness indeed makes
  evident, that the power of forming conceptions is antecedent to that of
  forming judgments expressed by propositions.</p>

  <p>But even if we proceed to form a judgment, as "trees and flowers
  exist," it may still be shown that the conjunction "and" connects the
  substantives "trees," "flowers," and not propositions. For if we reduce
  the given proposition to the form, "trees exist and flowers exist," the
  conjunction becomes wholly superfluous. It adds nothing whatever to the
  meaning of the separate propositions, "trees exist," "flowers exist."
  Omit, however, the conjunction between the substantives in the original
  proposition, and the sense is wholly lost. What meaning can we attach,
  except by a convention, to the form of words "trees flowers exist." Now
  there is, I conceive, no more obvious principle in grammar than that the
  doctrine of the elements of speech should be founded upon the examination
  of instances in which they have a real meaning&mdash;in which their
  employment is essential, not accidental.</p>

  <p>It is doubtless one of the consequences of the neglect of this
  principle, that the older grammarians have made it a part of the
  definition of a conjunction, that it is a word "devoid of signification"
  (<span title="phônê asêmos" class="grk">&phi;&#x1F7C;&nu;&eta;
  &#x1F04;&sigma;&eta;&mu;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>). See references in
  Harris, p. 240. Were the philosophy of grammar founded, as alone it truly
  can be, upon the laws of thought, I venture to think that such statements
  would no longer be accepted.</p>

  <p>If the views which I have expressed needed confirmation, they would to
  my own mind derive it from the circumstance, that on applying to the
  original proposition that "mathematical analysis of logic" to which H. C.
  K. refers (not, I think, without a shade of scorn), it is resolved into
  the elementary propositions, "trees exist," "flowers exist,"
  <i>unconnected by any sign</i>.</p>

  <p>Let us take, as a second example, the proposition, "All trees are
  endogens or exogens." If the subject, "all trees," is to be retained,
  there is, I conceive, but one way in which the above proposition can
  mentally be formed. We form the conception of that collection of things
  which comprises endogens and exogens together, and we refer, by an act of
  judgment, "all trees" to that collection. And thus <i>the subject "all
  trees," remaining unchanged</i>, the conjunction "or" connects the terms
  of the predicate, as the conjunction "and" in the previous example
  connected those of the subject. I am prepared to show that this is the
  only view of the proposition consistent with its strictly logical use. If
  H. C. K. insist upon the resolution "any tree is an endogen, or it is an
  exogen," I would ask him to define the word "it." He cannot interpret it
  as "any tree," for the resolution would then be invalid. It must be
  applied to a <i>particular</i> tree, and then the proposition resolved is
  really a "singular" one, and not the proposition whose subject is "all
  trees."</p>

  <p>Not only do conjunctions in certain cases couple words, but in so
  doing they manifest the dominion of mental laws and the operation of
  mental processes, which, though never yet recognised by grammarians and
  logicians, form an indispensable part of the only basis upon which logic
  as a science can rest. And however strange the assertion may appear, I do
  not hesitate to affirm that the science thus established is a
  mathematical one. I do not by this mean that its subject is the same as
  that of arithmetic or geometry. It is not the <i>quantitative</i> element
  to which the term is intended to refer. But I hold, with, I believe, an
  increasing school of mathematicians, that the processes of mathematics,
  as such, do not depend upon the nature of the subjects to which they are
  applied, but upon the nature of the laws to which those subjects, when
  they pass under the dominion of human thought, become obedient. Now the
  ultimate laws of the processes which are subsidiary to general reasoning,
  such as attention, conception, abstraction, as well as of those processes
  which are more immediately involved in inference, are such as to admit of
  perfect and connected development in a mathematical form alone. We may
  indeed, without any systematic investigation of those laws, collect
  together a system of rules and canons, and investigate their common
  principle. This the genius of Aristotle has done. But we cannot thus
  establish <i>general methods</i>. Above all, <!-- Page 181 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page181"></a>{181}</span>we cannot thus
  establish such methods as may really guide us where the unassisted
  intellect would be lost amid the complexity or subtlety of the
  combinations involved. How small, for instance, is the aid which we
  derive from the ordinary doctrines of the logicians in questions in which
  we have to consider the operation of mixed causes and in various
  departments of statistical and social inquiry, in which the intellectual
  difficulty is almost wholly a logical one.</p>

  <p>For the ground upon which some of these statements are made, I must
  refer to my recently-published work on the <i>Laws of Thought</i>. I
  trust to your courtesy to insert these remarks, and apologise for the
  undesigned length to which they have extended.</p>

<h3>ROBERT BLOET.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. ix., p. 105.)</p>

  <p>Robert, Earl of Moreton, and Odo, Bishop of Bayeux, the Conquerors
  uterine brothers, both accompanied William, acting conspicuous parts on
  his invasion of England in 1066. The former died about 1090. Odo had been
  elected Bishop as far back as 1049. In 1088 he headed a conspiracy
  against William II.; but being defeated at Rochester, retired to
  Normandy. The time of his death is uncertain, but is supposed to have
  occurred in 1096.</p>

  <p>The first notice of Robert Bloet's name, is as a witness to one of the
  charters of William II. to the monastery of Durham, granted in 1088 or
  1089. He was appointed Chancellor in 1090, consecrated Bishop of Lincoln
  in 1093, and died in 1123.</p>

  <p>These dates plainly prove that he was not "identical" with Robert,
  Earl of Moreton; and scarcely could be called cotemporary with him.</p>

  <p>His supposed relationship to Odo is affirmed by Richardson, in his
  notes to Goodwin <i>de Præsulibus</i>, from an expression in his grant of
  the manor of Charleton to the priory of Bermondsey (Claud. A. 8., f.
  118., MSS. Hutton); in which he says, "quod pro salute animæ Dom. mei
  Willelmi Regis, et <i>fratris mei</i> Bajocens. Episcopi." If Odo be the
  Bishop here intended, the meaning of "fratris mei" may be translated, not
  in the natural, but in the episcopal sense, as brother of his order. But
  the grant is probably a forgery, or its date of 1093 incorrect, for at
  that time Odo was in exile; and Bloet would have scarcely ventured to
  insult the king, from whom he had just received rewards and advancement,
  by coupling with his the name of one who had been banished as a
  traitor.</p>

<h3>PHOTOGRAPHIC CORRESPONDENCE.</h3>

  <p><i>A Hint to the Photographic Society.</i>&mdash;It has been objected
  to this Society, that beyond the establishment of its <i>Journal</i>, and
  the forming of an Exhibition, it has done very little to promote the
  improvement of the beautiful art it was specially intended to advance.
  Such objections are very easily urged; but those who make them should at
  least propose a remedy. It is in no unfriendly spirit that we allude to
  these complaints; and we well know how difficult it is for a body like
  the Photographic Society to take any important step which shall not be
  liable to misconstruction. We would however suggest, that among those
  endeavours which it would become the Society to make, there is one which
  might at once be taken, namely, to secure for the photographic public a
  good paper. The want of such an article is hourly felt. If the
  Photographic Society, following the example of the <i>Society of
  Arts</i>, should appoint a Committee to take this matter into
  consideration, to define clearly and unmistakeably the essentials of a
  good <i>negative</i> paper for calotypes (for perhaps it would be well to
  keep to a <i>good negative</i> paper), and offer a premium for its
  production, a very short time would elapse before specimens of such an
  article would be submitted for examination. It is clear that the premium
  need be one only of small pecuniary value; for the fact of a maker having
  produced such an article as should gain the prize, would secure him an
  ample recompense in the enormous demand which would instantly arise for a
  paper which should be stamped with the public approval of a body entitled
  to speak with so much authority on such a subject as the Council of the
  Photographic Society.</p>

  <p><i>Test for Nitrate of Silver.</i>&mdash;The <span class="sc">Reader
  of Photographic Works</span>, who in Vol. ix., p. 111., asked for
  information as to how he might know whether nitrate of silver was pure,
  can detect any impurities with which that salt is likely to be
  contaminated, by applying a few simple tests to an aqueous solution of
  it. The impurities which nitrate of silver most frequently contains are
  nitrate of copper, nitrate of potash, and free nitric acid. It is also
  sometimes intentionally adulterated with nitrate of lead. The presence of
  a salt of copper is detected by the solution assuming a blue colour when
  mixed with an excess of ammonia. To detect nitrate of potash,
  hydrochloric acid should be added to the solution in sufficient quantity
  to precipitate the whole of the silver. The liquid should then be freed
  from the precipitate by filtration, and evaporated; if nitrate of potash
  is present, a fixed residue will remain after evaporation. The presence
  of a salt of lead is detected by adding a few drops of sulphuric acid to
  the solution of nitrate of silver, which precipitates the lead as
  sulphate if present. It is, however, necessary to dilute the acid with a
  considerable quantity of water, and, if any precipitate forms, to allow
  it to subside previous to using it as a test for lead, as ordinary
  sulphuric acid is frequently contaminated with sulphate of lead, which is
  soluble in the strong, but not in dilute, acid.</p>

  <p>Any free nitric acid in the nitrate of silver can be detected by the
  smell. The crystals can be freed from <!-- Page 182 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page182"></a>{182}</span>it, should they contain
  any, by fusing them in a porcelain crucible over a spirit-lamp. The
  ordinary fused lunar caustic of the surgeon is unfit for general use as a
  photographic agent.</p>

  <p><i>Professor Hunt's Photographic Studies.</i>&mdash;My attention has
  just been directed to a "Practical Photographic Query" in your Journal,
  Vol. ix., p. 41., which appears to require a reply from me. It is quite
  evident that your correspondent, notwithstanding the personal respect
  which he professes to entertain, cannot have any intimate knowledge of
  either my works or my studies. Allow me to make my position clear to him
  and other of your readers. My first photographic experiment dates from
  January 28, 1839, and since that period the investigation of the
  <i>chemical phenomena of the solar rays</i> has been the constant
  employment of all the leisure which a busy life has afforded me. The
  production of photographic pictures has never been the ultimate object at
  which I have aimed, although my researches have caused me to obtain
  thousands. My object has been, and is, to endeavour to obtain some light
  into the mysteries of the radiant force with which the photographic
  artist works, being quite content to leave the production of beautiful
  images to other manipulators.</p>

  <p>As I write on the subject, it appears, of course, necessary that I
  should be familiar with all the details of manipulation in each process
  which I may describe. Whenever I have mentioned, in either of my works, a
  process with which I have not been entirely familiar, I have given the
  name of the authority upon whom I have depended. But there will not be
  found in either my <i>Photography</i>, or my <i>Researches on Light</i>
  (of which a greatly enlarged edition will soon be submitted to the
  public), any one process upon which I have not made such experiments as
  appeared to me necessary to my understanding the <i>rationale</i> of the
  chemical changes involved, and of the physical phenomena which arise.</p>

  <p>Now, since it is not necessary to select a picturesque object to
  instruct me in these points, the same buildings, trees, and plaster casts
  have been copied times beyond number; and when the problem under
  examination has been solved, these pictures have been destroyed.</p>

  <p>There are twenty exhibitors of pictures in the Photographic Gallery
  who would certainly leave my productions far behind, as it concerns their
  pictorial character; but I am confident there is not one who has made the
  philosophy of Photography so entirely his study as I have done.</p>

  <p>I have been engaged for the last two years in studying the chemical
  action of the prismatic spectrum. I inclose you my report on this subject
  to the British Association for 1852 (that for 1853 is now in the hands of
  the printer), from which you will perceive that I am employing myself to
  greater advantage to photography, as science under art, than I should be
  did I enter the lists with those who catch the beauties of external
  nature on their sensitive tablets, and secure for themselves and others
  pictures drawn by the solar pencil, in which no one can more deeply
  delight than your humble servant.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Robert Hunt.</span></p>

  <p><i>Waxed-paper Pictures.</i>&mdash;Will your correspondents or
  yourself do me the favour to say, how such beautiful pictures have been
  produced and exhibited by Mr. Fenton and others by the waxed-paper
  medium, if that process be so bad and defective? When I have followed it,
  and exercised consistent patience, I have ever produced pleasing and
  faithful results. That when parties do not themselves prepare, it becomes
  expensive, I am willing to admit; but I am inclined to attribute many
  failures to the uncertain heat of hot irons, which <i>must</i> vary; and
  I make this fact known to you as the result of my own observation on many
  sheets: added to which, defective manipulation, or impure chemicals, must
  not be allowed to do away with its having much merit.</p>

  <p><i>The Double Iodide Solution.</i>&mdash;In a note appended to <span
  class="sc">Dr. Mansell's</span> communication on the calotype (Vol. ix.,
  p. 134.), you state that having lately prepared the double iodide
  solution according to the formula given by <span class="sc">Dr.
  Diamond</span>, in which it required 650 grains of iodide of potassium to
  dissolve a 60-grain precipitate, you were inclined to believe, until you
  made the experiment yourself, that <span class="sc">Dr. Mansell</span>
  must have made a wrong calculation as to the quantity of iodide of
  potassium (680 grains) which he stated was sufficient to dissolve a
  100-grain precipitate, as the difference appeared so small for a solution
  more than one-third stronger.</p>

  <p>The small difference referred to with respect to the quantity of
  iodide of potassium required, is owing to the amount of water used being
  in both cases the same. A slight difference in the strength of a solution
  of iodide of potassium makes a great difference with respect to the
  quantity of iodide of silver it is capable of dissolving. Thus, if you
  remove a small proportion of the water from a solution of the double
  iodide of silver by evaporation, the slight increase of strength which
  the solution will thereby acquire, will enable it to take up a much
  larger proportion of iodide of silver than it already contains; and if,
  on the other hand, you dilute it with a small proportion of water, its
  diminished strength (unless the solution contains a great excess of
  iodide of potassium) will cause the precipitation of a large proportion
  of the iodide of silver. And hence the great variation in the amount of
  iodide of potassium which is found requisite to form a solution of the
  double iodide of silver, under the same apparent conditions with regard
  to the proportions of the other ingredients employed, may be accounted
  for by the impossibility of <i>measuring</i> off with sufficient accuracy
  the proper proportion of water.</p>

  <p>Whenever <i>exact</i> quantities of liquids are required, recourse
  should always be had to the balance, for no great accuracy can be
  depended upon by measurement with our ordinary glass measures, even
  supposing them to be correctly graduated, which is not always the
  case.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">J. Leachman.</span></p>

  <p><i>Dr. Mansell's Process.</i>&mdash;<span class="sc">Dr.
  Mansell's</span> lucid and very practical paper on the calotype process
  in "N. &amp; Q." must, I am sure, be of the greatest service to
  photographers in general; and as one of the many I am irresistibly
  tempted to offer my sincere and hearty <!-- Page 183 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page183"></a>{183}</span>thanks to him for the
  truly valuable hints it contains. If <span class="sc">Dr. Mansell</span>
  will give the rationale of the necessity of not allowing a longer time
  than absolutely required for the soaking out the now injurious iodide of
  potassium, set free by the deposit of the iodide of silver; and also, an
  explanation of the cause of that part of the iodized papers which takes
  the longest time in drying being weaker than that part which had been
  more hastily dried, the learned Doctor will still be adding to our
  present account of obligation to him.</p>

<h2>Replies to Minor Queries.</h2>

  <p><i>Buonaparte's Abdication</i> (Vol. ix., p. 54.).&mdash;In an article
  on this subject, after referring to Wilkinson's shop on Ludgate Hill,
  your correspondent states that "Wilkinson's shop does not now exist." In
  justice to ourselves, we trust you will insert this letter, as such a
  remark may be prejudicial to us. Having sold our premises on Ludgate Hill
  to the Milton Club, we have removed our establishment to No. 8. Old Bond
  Street, Piccadilly.</p>

  <p>As regards the table spoken of, your informant must be labouring under
  some strange error. We do not remember ever having, or pretending to
  have, the original table on which the Emperor Napoleon signed his
  abdication. Many years ago, a customer of ours lent us a table with some
  such plate as you describe, which he had had made abroad from the
  original, for us to copy from; and after this we made and sold several,
  but only as copies. We cannot charge our memory with the correctness of
  the inscription you publish; and, moreover, we believe the words "a
  fac-simile," or something to that effect, were engraved as a heading to
  those made by us.</p>

  the original table: "On Dec. 8, 1838, I saw the table on which Napoleon
  signed his abdication at the Chateau of Fontainebleau, on which there are
  two scratches or incisures said to have been made by him with a penknife.
  These injuries upon the surface of the table were so remarkable as to
  attract my attention, and I inquired about them of the attendant. He said
  Napoleon, when excited or irritated, was in the habit of handling and
  using anything which lay beside him, perhaps to allay mental agitation;
  and that he was considered to have so used a penknife, and disfigured the
  table."]</p>

  <p><i>Nattochiis and Calchanti</i> (Vol. ix., pp. 36. 84.).&mdash;The
  former of these words being sometimes spelt <i>natthocouks</i> in the
  same deed, shows the ignorance or carelessness of the scribe, the reading
  being clearly corrupt; I would suggest <i>cottagiis</i>, cottages, and by
  "g<sup>a</sup>nis" I should understand not <i>granis</i>, as F.S.A.
  supposes, but <i>gardinis</i>, gardens. The line will then run thus:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Cum omnibus gardinis et cottagiis adjacentibus."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>It will be seen that this differs from the solution proposed by <span
  class="sc">Mr. Thrupp</span> (p. 84.).</p>

  <p>With respect to the latter word, <i>calchanti</i>, I regret that I
  cannot offer a satisfactory solution. Possibly the word intended may have
  been <i>calcanthi</i>, copperas, vitriol, or the water of copper or
  brass; but I find in the <i>Index Alter</i> of Ainsworth, the
  word&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"<span class="sc">Calecantum.</span> A kind of earth like salt, of a
  binding nature. <i>Puto pro Chalcanthum, Vitriol, L.</i>"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Will this tally with the circumstances of the case? I presume that the
  words <i>liquor</i>, <i>mineral</i>, &amp;c., following <i>calchanti</i>
  in the grant, are contractions for the genitive plural of those words;
  the subject of the grant being the tithes of all those substances.</p>

  <p><i>"Spires 'whose silent finger points to heaven'"</i> (Vol. ix., pp.
  9. 85.).&mdash;F. R. M., M.A., seems not to have observed that Wordsworth
  marks this line as a quotation; and in the note upon it
  (<i>Excursion</i>, 373.) gives the poetical passage in <i>The Friend</i>,
  whence he took it, thus acknowledging Coleridge to be the author. The
  passage is not to be found in the modern edition of <i>The Friend</i>, by
  the reference in Wordsworth's note to "<i>The Friend</i>, No. 14. p.
  223." I presume that <i>The Friend</i> was originally published in
  numbers, and that it is to that publication Wordsworth refers. This is
  not simply the case, as F. R. M., M.A., suggests, of two authors using
  the same idea, but of one also honestly acknowledging his debt to the
  other. The idea is of much older date than the prose of Coleridge, or the
  verse of Wordsworth. Milton, in his Epitaph on Shakspeare, has:</p>

  <p><i>Arms of Richard, King of the Romans</i> (Vol. viii., p.
  653.).&mdash;With respectful submission to <span class="sc">Mr. Norris
  Deck</span>, and notwithstanding his ingenious conjecture that the
  charges on the border are pois, and the seal which he mentions in his
  last communication, I think the evidence that the border belongs to
  Cornwall, and not to Poictou, is perfectly conclusive.</p>

  <p>1. The fifteen bezants in a sable field have been time out of mind
  regarded as the arms of Cornwall, and traditionally (but of course
  without authority) ascribed to Cadoc, or Caradoc, a Cornish prince of the
  fifth century. They occur in juxtaposition with the garbes of Chester,
  upon some of the great seals of England, and I think also upon the tomb
  of Queen Elizabeth; and they are, to the present day, printed or engraved
  on the mining leases of the duchy.</p>

  <p>2. Bezants on sable are extremely frequent in the arms of Cornish
  families; but crowned lions rampant gules do not occur in a single
  instance of which I am aware, except in the arms of families named
  Cornwall, who are known or presumed to be descended from this Richard,
  and bear his arms with sundry differences. Bezants on sable are borne
  (<i>e.g.</i>) by Bond, Carlyon, Chamberlayne, Cole, Cornwall (by some
  without the lion), Killegrew, Saint-Aubyn, Treby, Tregyan (with a crowned
  eagle sable, holding a sword), Treiago, and Walesborough, all of
  Cornwall; and it is to be remarked that bezants are not a common bearing
  in other parts of England, especially not on sable.</p>

  <p>3. When Roger Valtorte married Joan, daughter of Reginald de
  Dunstanville (who was natural son of Henry I., and Earl of Cornwall
  nearly a century before Richard, King of the Romans, but never Earl of
  Poictou), he added to his paternal arms a border sable bezantée.</p>

  <p>This is but a small portion of the evidence which might be adduced;
  but it is, I think, quite enough to justify the statements of Sylvanus
  Morgan, Sandford, Mr. Lower, and others, that the bezants pertain not to
  Poictou, but to Cornwall.</p>

  <p><i>Brothers with the same Christian Name</i> (Vol. viii., pp. 338.
  478.).&mdash;If your various correspondents, who adduce instances of two
  brothers in families having the same Christian names (both brothers being
  alive), will consult Lodge's <i>Peerage</i> for 1853, they will find the
  names of the sons of the Marquis of Ormonde thus stated:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"James Edward Wm. Theobald, Earl of Ossory, born Oct. 5, 1844.</p>

  <p>"Lord James Hubert Henry Thomas, born Aug. 20, 1847.</p>

  <p>"Lord James Arthur Wellington Foley, born Sept. 23, 1849.</p>

  <p>"Lord James Theobald Bagot John, born Aug. 6, 1852."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The Christian name of the late Marquis was James; and whichever of his
  grandsons shall succeed the present possessor of the title, will bear the
  same Christian name as the late peer.</p>

  <p><i>Arch-priest in the Diocese of Exeter</i> (Vol. ix., p.
  105.).&mdash;Haccombe is doubtless the parish in the diocese of Exeter,
  where <span class="sc">Mr. W. Fraser</span> will find the arch-priest
  about whom he is inquiring. Haccombe is a small parish, having two houses
  in it, the manor-house of the Carew family and the parsonage. It is said
  that, by a grant from the crown, in consequence of services done by an
  ancestor of the Carews, this parish received certain privileges and
  exemptions, one of which was that the priest of Haccombe should be exempt
  from all ordinary spiritual jurisdiction. Hence the title of arch-priest,
  and that of chorepiscopus, which the priests of Haccombe have claimed,
  and perhaps sometimes received. The incumbent of Bibury, in
  Gloucestershire, used to claim similar titles, and like exemption from
  spiritual jurisdiction.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">J. Sansom.</span></p>

  <p>Since sending my Query on this subject, I have obtained the following
  information. The Rectory of Haccombe, which is a peculiar one, in the
  diocese of Exeter, gives to its incumbent for the time being the dignity
  of arch-priest of the diocese. The arch-priest wears lawn sleeves, and on
  all occasions takes precedence after the bishop. The late rector, the
  Rev. T. C. Carew, I am told, constantly officiated in lawn sleeves
  attached to an A. M. gown, and took the precedence due to his spiritual
  rank as arch-priest of the diocese. The present arch-priest and Rector of
  Haccombe is the Rev. Fitzwilliam J. Taylor. Does such an office, or
  rather dignity, exist in any other case in the Anglican Church?</p>

  <p><i>"Horam coram dago"</i> (Vol. ix., p. 58.).&mdash;Your correspondent
  <span class="grk">&Sigma;</span>. is probably thinking of Burns' lines
  "Written in a wrapper, inclosing a letter to Captain Grose," &amp;c.:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Ken ye aught o' Captain Grose?</p>
      <p class="i1">Igo et ago,</p>
      <p>If he's among his friends or foes,</p>
      <p class="i1"><i>Iram, coram, dago</i>."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>It is not very likely, however, that this should be the first
  appearance of this "burden," any more than of "Fal de ral," which Burns
  gives to other pieces both before and after this. It may have a meaning
  (as I believe one has been found for "Lilliburlero," &amp;c.), but I
  should think it more likely to be sheer <i>gibberish</i>.</p>

  <p>By the way, how comes <i>burden</i> to be used in the sense of "chorus
  or refrain?" I believe we have the authority of Shakspeare for so
  doing.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Foot it featly here and there</p>
      <p>And let the rest the burden bear?"</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Is it the <i>bourdon</i>, or big drone? Certainly the chorus could not
  "bear a burden," in the sense of <i>hard work</i>, even before the time
  of Hullah.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">J. P. Orde.</span></p>

  <p>In Chambers' <i>Scottish Songs</i>, Edinburgh, 1829, p. 273. is a
  piece beginning&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"And was you e'er in Crail toun?</p>
      <p class="i1"><i>Igo and ago</i>;</p>
      <p>And saw ye there clerk Fishington?</p>
      <p class="i1">Sing <i>irom, igon, ago</i>."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>And in <i>Blackwood</i> for Jan. 1831 ("Noctes Ambrosianæ, No. 53.")
  is "A Christmas Carol in honour of Maga, sung by the Contributors," which
  begins thus&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"When Kit North is dead,</p>
      <p class="i1">What will Maga do, Sir?</p>
      <p>She must go to bed,</p>
      <p class="i1">And like him die too, Sir!</p>
      <p class="i2">Fal de ral de ral,</p>
      <p class="i3"><i>Iram coram dago</i>;</p>
      <p class="i2">Fal de ral de ral,</p>
      <p class="i3">Here's success to Maga!"</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>I suspect that the "chorus or refrain" of the first of these ditties
  suggested that of the second; and that <i>this</i> is the song which was
  running in your contributor's head.</p>

  <p><i>Children by one Mother</i> (Vol. v., p. 126.).&mdash;In reply to
  the Query, "If there be any well-authenticated instance of a woman having
  had more than twenty-five children," I can furnish you with what I firmly
  believe to be such an instance. The narrator was a relative of my late
  wife, a man of the very highest character in the City of London for many
  years, and formerly clerk to the London Bridge (Old) Water Works, a mark
  by which he may possibly be recognised by some of your readers. I have
  heard him relate, that once, as he was travelling into Essex, he met with
  a very respectable woman, apparently a farmer's wife, who during the
  journey several times expressed an anxious desire to reach home, which
  induced my informant at length to inquire the cause of so great an
  anxiety. Her reply was, "Indeed, Sir, if you knew, you would not wonder
  at it." When, upon his jocularly saying, "Surely she could have no cause
  for so much desire to reach home," she said farther, that "The number of
  her children was the cause, for that she had <i>thirty</i> children, it
  having pleased God to give to her and her husband fifteen boys; and
  because they were much dissatisfied at having no girl, in order to punish
  their murmuring and discontent, He was pleased farther to send them
  fifteen girls."</p>

  <p><i>Parochial Libraries</i> (Vol. viii. <i>passim</i>).&mdash;In the
  small village of Halton, Cheshire, there is a small public library, of no
  inconsiderable extent and importance, founded in 1733 by Sir John
  Chesshyre, Knight, of Hallwood in that county. Of the works comprised in
  the collection, the following may be selected as best worthy of mention:
  Dugdale's <i>Monasticon</i>, Rymer's <i>F&oelig;dera</i>, Walton's
  <i>Polyglot</i>, and a host of standard ecclesiastical authors,
  interspersed with modern additions of more general interest. The curate
  for the time being officiates as librarian; the books being preserved in
  a small stone building set apart for the purpose, in the vicinity of his
  residence. Over the door is the following inscription:</p>

<p class="ac">"Hanc Bibliothecam,<br/>
pro communi literatorum usu,<br/>
sub cura curati capellæ de Halton<br/>
proventibus ter feliciter augmentatæ,<br/>
<span class="sc">Johannes Chesshyre</span> miles<br/>
serviens D'ni Regis ad legem,<br/>
D. D. D.<br/>
Anno MDCCXXXIII."</p>

  <p>Sir John, the founder, was buried at Runcorn, where a monument exists
  to his memory, bearing the following epitaph at its foot:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"A wit's a feather, and a chief's a rod,</p>
      <p>An honest man's the noblest work of God."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The parishes of Stoke Damarel, Devon, and of St. James the Great,
  Devonport, have each their parochial library: the former commenced in
  1848, by the Rev. W. B. Flower, late curate of the parish; and the latter
  by the Rev. W. B. Killpack, the first incumbent of the district.</p>
